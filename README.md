Description
-----------

With the Grouptool activity, teachers can create groups and give students the opportunity to register and deregister for these groups independently or, if necessary, to register for waiting lists. 


Usage
-------

In a course, the participants are to give group presentations. The teacher therefore creates a group for each presentation topic in the grouptool and specifies the maximum number of participants for each topic. They also allow waiting lists. Students can now register for the group of their choice within the specified period. If the desired group is already full, they can sign up for the waiting list and move up if someone in the group de-registers. After the registration deadline, the teacher starts an allocation process that assigns the participants on the waiting list to other groups with open places.


Installation
------------

* Copy the  code directly to the mod/grouptool directory.

* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation
  automatically.


Privacy API 
--------------

The plugin fully implements the Moodle Privacy API.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-mod_grouptool/issues). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a
screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
